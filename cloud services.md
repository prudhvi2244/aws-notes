# Main Types of Cloud Services (Service Models)
## These are the building blocks of cloud computing, each giving you a different level of control and responsibility

# IaaS â€“ Infrastructure as a Service
## ðŸ’¡ "You manage the software; the cloud provider manages the hardware."
## You rent virtual machines, storage, and networks from a cloud provider.
## You install and manage your own apps, OS, and data.

# âœ… Example Services:
### Amazon EC2 (AWS) â€“ virtual servers
### Google Compute Engine
### Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines

# ðŸ§  Real-life Use Case:
## A startup needs to host a website. Instead of buying physical servers, they rent virtual servers on AWS (EC2) and install their software.

# PaaS â€“ Platform as a Service
### "You write the code; the cloud provider handles everything else."
### You get a ready-to-use platform to build and deploy applications.
### No need to worry about servers, operating systems, or infrastructure.

# âœ… Example Services:
### Google App Engine
### Heroku
### Microsoft Azure App Services

# ðŸ§  Real-life Use Case:
## A developer builds a web app and deploys it on Heroku. They donâ€™t need to manage the server or OSâ€”just focus on coding the app.


# SaaS â€“ Software as a Service
### ðŸ’¡ "You use the software; everything is handled for you."
### Fully functional applications delivered over the internet.
### No setup or installation needed. Just log in and use it.

# âœ… Example Services:
### Gmail, Google Docs
### Microsoft 365
#### Salesforce
#### Zoom

# ðŸ§  Real-life Use Case:
## A student uses Google Docs to write essays. The software runs entirely onlineâ€”no installation needed.
