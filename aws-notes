# What is Cloud Computing?
** Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active
management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.


What is a Data Center?
A data center is a physical location that stores computing machines and their related hardware equipment. It contains the computing infrastructure that IT systems require, such as servers, data storage drives, and network equipment.

In the data center, compute refers to the processing power and memory required to run applications on a server. It is one of the three major components of data center along with storage and networking.

Types of cloud computing
******************************
There are four main types of cloud computing
1)private clouds
2)public clouds
3)hybrid clouds
4)Multiclouds


Public cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Public clouds deliver resources, such as compute, storage, network, develop-and-deploy environments, and applications over the internet. They are owned and run by third-party cloud service providers like Google Cloud,AWS, Microsoft Azure.

Private cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Private clouds are built, run, and used by a single organization, typically located on-premises. They provide greater control, customization, and data security but come with similar costs and resource limitations associated with traditional IT environments.

Hybrid cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Environments that mix at least one private computing environment (traditional IT infrastructure or private cloud, including edge) with one or more public clouds are called hybrid clouds. They allow you to leverage the resources and services from different computing environments and choose which is the most optimal for the workloads. 


Multi Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Multi-cloud model includes two or more public cloud services. Multi-cloud systems use only public cloud services.



Cloud Computing Services
*******************************
There are three main types of cloud computing services
1)Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
2)Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS)
3)Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
4)Function-as-a-Service ( FaaS)



Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
*******************************************
IaaS delivers on-demand infrastructure resources, such as compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. With IaaS, the service provider owns and operates the infrastructure, but customers will need to purchase and manage software, such as operating systems, middleware, data, and applications.

Example : Buying pre-packed ingredients like fresh pasta and sauce made by someone else that you use to cook at home. 

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS delivers and manages hardware and software resources for developing, testing, delivering, and managing cloud applications. Providers typically offer middleware, development tools, and cloud databases within their PaaS offerings.

Example : Order takeout or delivery where your meal is prepared for you and you don’t have to worry about the ingredients or how you’ll cook it, but you have to worry about where you’ll eat, the utensils, and cleaning up after your meal.  

Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS provides a full application stack as a service that customers can access and use. SaaS solutions often come as ready-to-use applications, which are managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

Example : Call ahead to the restaurant and order the exact meal you want. They prepare everything ahead of time for you so that all you have to do is show up and eat.

Function-as-a-Service ( FaaS)
Serverless computing in cloud service models is also called Function as a Service (FaaS). This is a relatively new cloud service model that provides solutions to build applications as simple, event-triggered functions without managing or scaling any infrastructure.

Example : Go out to dinner and order pasta at a restaurant, alone or with friends. You pay and eat whatever you want and the restaurant makes sure there’s enough ingredients and staff to create the order without a long wait.
