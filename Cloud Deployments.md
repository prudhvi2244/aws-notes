# Types of Cloud Deployment Models
### There are four main types of cloud deployments. They describe how the cloud infrastructure is set up and who has access to it.

1. Public Cloud
## What is it?
### The cloud services are provided over the public internet and shared across multiple users (tenants).
### Managed by third-party providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.

# ✅ Pros:
### Cost-effective (no need to buy hardware)
### Easy to scale
### No maintenance (the provider handles it)

# ⚠️ Cons:
### Less control
### Shared environment (potential security concerns for sensitive data)

# 🧠 Example:
## Storing files in Google Drive or running a website on AWS EC2

2. Private Cloud
# 🏢 What is it?
### Cloud infrastructure used exclusively by one organization.
### Can be hosted on-premises (in your own data center) or by a third-party provider.

# ✅ Pros:
### High security and control
### Customization options
### Great for sensitive or regulated data

# ⚠️ Cons:
### Expensive to build and maintain
### Less flexibility than public cloud

# 🧠 Example:
### A bank builds its own private cloud to securely store customer data

3. Hybrid Cloud
# 🔗 What is it?
### A mix of public and private clouds, connected to work together.
### Allows data and apps to move between the two as needed.

# ✅ Pros:
### Flexible and scalable
### Keeps sensitive data private while still using the public cloud when needed
### Good balance of cost and control

# ⚠️ Cons:
### Can be complex to manage and integrate
### Requires strong security and network setup

# 🧠 Example:
### A hospital keeps patient data in a private cloud but runs its public website on AWS

4. Community Cloud (Less common)
# 👥 What is it?
### A cloud environment shared by multiple organizations with similar needs or regulations (e.g., healthcare, government).

# ✅ Pros:
### Cost is shared between members
### Tailored to industry-specific requirements

# ⚠️ Cons:
### Not widely used or available
### Shared responsibility

# 🧠 Example:
### Several universities collaborate using a shared research cloud platform
