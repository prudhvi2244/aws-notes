# What is cloud?
## The cloud refers to a network of servers that store and process data remotely, rather than on local machines or physical hardware. It provides on-demand access to various computing resources (like storage, computing power, databases, software, etc.) over the internet.

## The cloud is like a virtual space where data, applications, and services are hosted and made accessible through the internet, rather than being confined to a physical location.

# Key Characteristics of Cloud

## Remote Access
Cloud services can be accessed from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection. This means you can use services and store data without needing a physical server or hard drive on your premises.

## On-Demand Availability
Cloud resources are available on-demand, meaning you can access and scale them up or down depending on your needs, without having to buy or maintain physical hardware.

## Scalability
The cloud allows for easy scaling. If you need more storage, processing power, or bandwidth, you can quickly increase your resources, often without downtime.

## Pay-As-You-Go
Instead of paying for physical infrastructure upfront, cloud services are typically offered on a subscription or pay-per-usage basis. You only pay for the resources you actually use.

## Managed by Providers
Cloud service providers (like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) maintain and manage the infrastructure, ensuring that you donâ€™t have to worry about hardware, maintenance, or security.
